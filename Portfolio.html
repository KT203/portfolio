        <i>Murder in Suburbia</i> (2022) 
       <br>
         Video (Premier Pro)

        <br><br>
         <i>Murder in Suburbia</i> is a video about the dark side of a seemingly picture-perfect suburban neighbourhood. The video is made using the visual footage from <i>This is Marshal</i> and the audio from <i>New Town</i>. The idealistic neighbourhood is depicted with cheery jingle sound effects, upbeat audio and dialogue narrating a nice neighbourhood. The audio is accompanied by footage of school children, a smiling dolphin, and other neutral/happy footages. The video then shifts to suspenseful audio as the picturesque image of the town is ruined with ominous montages and an allusion of murder. The concept of this video is to represent the idea that everything is not always what they seem to be.  
        </p>
          
   <h3> Reflection</h3>
       <p>
         I based the concept of the video from the audio from <i>New Town</i>. <i>New Town’s</i> audio has a mixture of happy, cheery jingle sounds and sinister, suspenseful buzzing sounds. I thought basing my video storyline on these juxtaposing sounds would make an interesting narrative. I then chose the video <i>This is Marshal</i> as it had a montage of different things that also had a dark a sinister tone.

          <p> I decided on a narrative that would introduce the audience to a happy, picture-perfect neighbourhood that is later revealed to be a lie.  
            Therefore, when choosing footage, I tried picking visuals that I can weave into my concept with the help of the audio to portray the emotion of the scene. 
            The pre-existing video has a dark lighting and static texture that fits well with the idea of a corrupted and creepy neighbourhood. Finding existing footage 
            to portray a happy neighbourhood was harder. I chose footage with neutral things and objects in it and rely on the audio, and non-diegetic sound to convey tone.

          <p> I tried to edit the video according to the rhythm of the audio. 
            The first half of the audio is cheerful and upbeat while the second half consist of intense buzzing crescendos that builds a feeling of suspense, 
            and the tempo is overall faster. So, in the first half of the video I would use less cuts and I would have longer footage, whereas in the second half 
            I had more cuts and mismatching of footages to keep up with the faster pace audio.

           <i>Warning Signs</i> is a series of nine icons made in Illustrator that is intended to be used in a post-apocalyptic world as warning signs for different scenarios. The idea sprung from the theme 'Futures' and the concept is inspired by the ideas of current road and warning signs. When thinking about post-apocalyptic the movie <i>Mad Max</i> and the video game <i>Fallout 76: Nuclear Winter</i> was a source of inspiration. The icons are divided into groups of threes and each sub-group as a theme. One group is related to mutated creatures, the second is focused on radiation danger, and the last group is related to safety procedure and equipment. The sound effects on each icon are utilised to further convey and compliment the imagery of the icons.

              The prompt I chose was Future as the theme of this project. As shown in my brainstorm I had two main branches of ideas. One direction is to go futuristic sci-fi, and the other direction is post-apocalyptic futures. 
              <br>
              The main idea behind my suite icons is that in a post-apocalyptic world these icons would be used as warning signs to signify a certain meaning using visuals only. I was inspired by the idea as road sign, and other visual signage being used currently. For example, I’ve divided the suit of 9 icons into 3 sub sections. The first being a sign depicting mutated life forms (plants, animals, humans) The second set is focus on depicting nuclear & radiation related things, (mine field, broken down nuclear plant, nuclear rubbish). Finally, the third set relates to safety ( Gas mask, decontamination shower, full radioactive site).

                I was quite steadfast with my initial concept and idea, however, settling into 
                Regarding, the imagery of how to depict the idea behind each individual sign went through a few iterations. 
                In terms of arching concept for the suite of icons I was steadfast in my initial apocalyptic idea, 
                however regarding what kind of imagery best suit each individual sign concept I went through  a few iterations some more than others.

                Nuclear Power Plant – as I was in the process of creating this icon, I realise it look too much like icons we currently use. So, I decided to depict a broken down and damaged nuclear power plant to stick to the post-apocalyptic theme.

                Mutated plant icon - I originally wanted to use the radioactive sig, but as I translated that idea into a Vector Illustrations, I realise the organic shape of the leaves/vines was too dominant in the icon and therefore did not fit the aesthetic of the rest of the icons. That is how I’ve ended up with this final plant design. 
              </p>
          </div>

      </div>

      <p>Since I was finalising the icon designs while still in Illustrator, I decided to use basic black and yellow colour palette found in road signs. Then when I’ve finalised the icon design, I mainly chose complimentary and split complementary colours as I wanted high contrast like the black and yellow used for road signs. This would make the icon to be discernible from a further distant. Since I was basing my design on the concept of warning signs for a post-apocalyptic world I knew I needed to keep to a simple colour palette where the background is one colour and the icons is coloured using a contrasting colour. </p>

              <i>Time to Rest</i> is a 3D-Environemnt build in Unity using free online assets. 
              The environment is divided into 2 sections and while walking through the environment this transition is indicated by the player walking through a bubble layer and the sky changes. 
              Within the blue bubble there’s a city/suburban landscape with apartments, houses, parks, and community areas. 
              Traffic and children playing sound effects are added in this area to immerse players in the environment. 
              Past the blue bubble, the player is faced with a natural landscape with a wooden cabin on the left and small lake surrounded by flora on the right. 
              Following along the dirt path that leads to a narrow end with a bench overlooking the edge of the map into the ocean. The idea behind the two different 
              landscape is to represent the busy lifestyle associated with urban living while the natural landscape represent the opposite of the busy lifestyle; a relax and leisurely life. The dreamlike tone, 
              the innocent childlike aesthetic is style like that of Ghibli movies and idleness and relax mood is inspired by the video game <i>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</i>.

                  With my initial concept as seen in the 2-D map I created did not translate well into creating a 3D Environment. 
                  As I was designing the map, I was only thinking the about the layout and did not consider the 3D element of the space and how that would be made in Unity. 
                  This is what made me abandon my initial idea. I think now that I have a better understanding of Unity works the next time, I make a 2D prototype I would keep the 3D element in mind and questioning the feasibility of my ideas. 
                  <br>
                  With the 3D environment the placement of things in the 3D space needs to consider and design. 
                  The relativity between the Hight of the camera vs the surrounding needs to be considered, whereas in Assignment 1 all I had to consider in 1 2D perspective.

           <p>I used sound in A3 to help build an immersive environment, mood, and tone whereas in A1&2 I used sound to achieve slightly different goals. In A1, sound was used as a tool to help tell a story and bring the audience along from the start of the video to the ends. It was also used to help set the tone and invoke emotions. In A2, sound was used as an additional way to clarify and solidify the meaning of the icons. 
            <br><br>
            When choosing assets, I stuck to low poly assets as they usually have a similar look to them which makes it easier to mix and match different assets pack while still creating a unified environment. Having the sky box and an underlying music playing throughout the maps helps.
